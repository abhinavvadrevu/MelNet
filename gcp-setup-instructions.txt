Set the instance name and public address
    VM_NAME="chronicle-test2-vm"
    VM_ADDRESS="34.122.37.112"

Grant the instance access roles at the instance level by using

    gcloud compute instances add-iam-policy-binding $VM_NAME --member='user:abhinav@gooty.co' --role='roles/compute.osAdminLogin' --zone=us-central1-b

To connect to instance via terminal:

    gcloud compute ssh --project=chronicle-306003 $VM_NAME

To login via ssh command:

    ssh -i ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine abhinav_gooty_co@$VM_ADDRESS



======= One-time commands =======

To add SSH keys to account (probably just a one-time command)
    gcloud compute os-login ssh-keys add \
      --key-file=/Users/abhinavvadrevu/.ssh/google_compute_engine.pub \
      --ttl=0
